\description{
A subset of human Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMC) scRNA-seq data that
was sequenced using Drop-seq platform. The Seurat(version 4.0.5) package was used for
normalized using the NormalizeData function with the "LogNormalize" method and
a scale factor of 10,000. After modeling the mean-variance relationship with the
FindVariableFeautre function within "vst" methods, we selected the top 2,000 highly
variable genes and only used this selection going forward. The dataframe of the
cell type label and a gene expression matrix of 598 cells in the row and 2,000
genes in the column.
